## Description
#### The AcuPoint Bubble Chart app is a a straightforward app with 150+ high definition, color-coded acupoint locator anatomic tables.
#### It replaces cumbersome laminated point charts with a quick, simple, and reliable acupoint reference
#### The app has been built with these aims in mind:
1. closely **mimic** the traditional **5 Element Traditional Chinese Medicine chart** to minimized attrition for busy practitioners
2. be **offline available**, as Equine practitioner often work in remote areas without good data service
3. be **intuitive to navigate**, as practioners often only have one hand free, and their attention is mostly on the animals they're working on
4. be streamlined and simple: **the UI disappears** and the user can concentrate on the job at hand
5. the **images** need to be **codified and simple to understand**: anatomical location (front/back, inside/ouside) as well as meridian yin/yang.

## Work In Progress...
#### There's only a few features missing before release, namely:
1. Acupunture point anatomic tables need to be completed
2. The species setting needs to be save-able (UserDefaults) so that practitioners who only work with Equine/Small Animals can set the species and forget it

## Future Features
#### There's a few features I would like the app to have in the future.
1. Zoom in to the acupoint: the traditional double-tap feature will zoom in so that the acupoint will be in the cneter of the screen. A simple zoom in would often zoom in to a feature that is not relevant.
   - To implement this, I will make a 3x3 grid, number it 1->9 and assign each acupoint a number based on its location on the image
   - Most user will be utilizing the app one handed, so pinching in and out is not an option
2. Acupunture point descriptions need to be written from scratch. Currently used acupoint descriptions tend to be wordy and mention anatomical structures are one seldom uses out of the classroom
3. 3 iPad support: although most equine practitioners don't use iPads in the field, many clinics have iPad for reference material, so this would support an increased usage of the app
4. Add Back-Shu, Mu-alarming, Luo-connecting, and Xi-cleft points to each element's circle
5. Add Lower He-Sea poins to the earth point of Large instestine, Triple Heater and Small Intestine
6. Add Eight confluent points
