#  AcuPoints Bubble Chart

### Acupuncture Bubble Chart for Equine and Small Animal practitioners

## Description
#### The AcuPoint Bubble Chart app is a a straightforward app with 150+ high definition, color-coded acupoint locator anatomic tables.
### The aim of this app is to expand an acupuncturists repertoire by replacing cumbersome laminated point charts with an intuitive UI that makes choosing and correctly locating seldom used points quick, simple, and reliable
#### The app has been built with these aims in mind:
1. closely **mimic** the traditional **5 Element Traditional Chinese Medicine chart** to minimized attrition for busy practitioners
2. be **offline available**, as Equine practitioner often work in remote areas without good data service
3. be **intuitive to navigate**, as practioners often only have one hand free, and their attention is mostly on the animals they're working on
4. be streamlined and simple: **the UI disappears** and the user can concentrate on the job at hand
5. the **images** need to be **codified and simple to understand**: anatomical location (front/back, inside/ouside) as well as meridian yin/yang.

## Work In Progress...
#### There's only a few features missing before release, namely:
1. Acupunture point anatomic tables need to be completed
2. Saving the species setting so that practitioners who only work with Equine/Small Animals can set the species and forget it (UserDefaults)

## Future Features
#### There's a few features I would like the app to have in the future.
1. Zoom in to the acupoint: the traditional double-tap feature will zoom in so that the acupoint will be in the cneter of the screen. A simple zoom in would often zoom in to a feature that is not relevant.
   - To implement this, I will make a 3x3 grid, number it 1->9 and assign each acupoint a number based on its location on the image
   - Most user will be utilizing the app one handed, so pinching in and out is not an option
2. Acupunture point descriptions need to be written from scratch. Currently used acupoint descriptions tend to be wordy and mention anatomical structures are one seldom uses out of the classroom
